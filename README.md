# SpicyMap
 Super Minimal StS modbase derived from pro-template.

 Initial Setup Steps:
 
 1) Refactor the Folders called SpicyMap to whatever you wanna call your mod in IntelliJ. (Right click, refactor.
 2) Change the ModID in pom.xml and the primary mod file (SpicyMap.java) to your modID (has to be lower case).

 Step-By-Step branching, coming soon (add this to wiki)
